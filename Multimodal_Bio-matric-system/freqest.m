% FREQEST - Estimate fingerprint ridge frequency within image block
%
% Function to estimate the fingerprint ridge frequency within a small block
% of a fingerprint image.  This function is used by RIDGEFREQ
%
% Usage:
%  freqim =  freqest(im, orientim, windsze, minWaveLength, maxWaveLength)
%
% Arguments:
%         im       - Image block to be processed.
%         orientim - Ridge orientation image of image block.
%         windsze  - Window length used to identify peaks. This should be
%                    an odd integer, say 3 or 5.
%         minWaveLength,  maxWaveLength - Minimum and maximum ridge
%                     wavelengths, in pixels, considered acceptable.
% 
% Returns:
%         freqim    - An image block the same size as im with all values
%                     set to the estimated ridge spatial frequency.  If a
%                     ridge frequency cannot be found, or cannot be found
%                     within the limits set by min and max Wavlength
%                     freqim is set to zeros.
%
% Suggested parameters for a 500dpi fingerprint image
%   freqim = freqest(im,orientim, 5, 5, 15);
%

%
% Note I am not entirely satisfied with the output of this function.
