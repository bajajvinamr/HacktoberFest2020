# 🎲 Guessing Game App
This is a number guessing game where you have to guess the correct number and everytime you guess you'll be charged with an attempt.<br>A person with minimum number of attempts wins the game.

# 🎮 How to Play ?
* You have to guess any random number between 1-100 at first if the number you chose is lower than the correct number then a message will pop up (Higher Number Please) and if you chose a number higher than the correct number than it will show (Lower Number Please).
  
* If you try to choose a number less than 0 or greater than 100 then a pop-up (toast) will be popped up asking you to enter a valid number.

* Once you guessed the correct number, a Congratulation message will be shown and the number of tries will be mentioned.

* You can either quit the game or you can replay.
