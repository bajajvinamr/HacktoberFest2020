# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detector
The inspiration for this was taken from Adrian Rosebrock (PyImageSearch). This project aims to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not. It is implemented in Python using Keras and OpenCV. 



### There are a few different datasets available for this project on the internet, I have used the one from [Prajna](https://github.com/prajnasb).
Here is the google drive link for the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PruHnSocJppeW24rzrXNb8G0IWe-r9ro?usp=sharing)
