        Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether
        you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of
        any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive
        contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill
        levels are encouraged to complete the challenge. Hacktoberfest is open
        to everyone in our global community! Pull requests can be made in any
        GitHub-hosted repositories/projects. Sign up anytime between October 1
        and October 31.
      </p>
      <h3 class="display-4 mt-5">Rules:</h3>
      <p class="card-body" style="color: white">
        To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you
        must register and make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in
        any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only
        the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your
        pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of
        conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first
        70,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will earn a
        T-shirt.
