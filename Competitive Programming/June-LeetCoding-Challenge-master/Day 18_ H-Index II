Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
          
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int n=citations.size();
        int i=0,j=citations.size()-1,mid,ans;
        while(i<=j)
        {
            mid=i+(j-i)/2;
            if(citations[mid]==(n-mid))
            {
                return citations[mid];
            }
            if(citations[mid]<(n-mid))
                i=mid+1;
            else
                j=mid-1;
        }
        return n-i;
    }
};
