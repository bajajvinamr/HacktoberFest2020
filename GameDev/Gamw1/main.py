# have a event of quit. we declared a running value for True. removing pass from while loop and seeing what's is
# happening in game window. Let's just code in while loop again we go to a for loop for a variable event from all the
# events happening in window. NOW WE CHECK IF WE CLICK CLOSE button then we get out of while loop by making it False.
